# Test Suite Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive verification tests for the grid-based MDP solver implementation. These tests help ensure the AI-generated code is mathematically correct and handles edge cases properly.

## 🎯 Purpose

When working with AI-generated code, especially for mathematical/scientific applications, it's crucial to verify correctness beyond "it runs without errors." These tests provide:

1. **Mathematical Verification**: Ensure algorithms satisfy theoretical properties
2. **Empirical Validation**: Compare analytical computations with sampling
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Verify boundary conditions and special cases
4. **Physics Correctness**: Confirm dynamics match specifications

## 📁 Test Files

### `test_transitions.py`
**Tests analytical transition probability computation**

- ✓ Probabilities sum to 1.0 for all state-action pairs
- ✓ No negative probabilities
- ✓ Zero velocity case (deterministic, no wobble)
- ✓ Crash probability correctness
- ✓ Boundary state handling

**Run:** `python test_transitions.py`

### `test_monte_carlo_validation.py`
**Validates analytical transitions against empirical sampling**

Compares the analytically computed transition probabilities with actual Monte Carlo sampling from the continuous dynamics. This catches subtle bugs where the analytical formula might differ from the actual system behavior.

- ✓ Random state-action pairs
- ✓ Edge cases (zero velocity, boundaries, high velocity)
- ✓ Statistical significance testing (TV distance)

**Run:** `python test_monte_carlo_validation.py` (takes ~2 min)

### `test_physics.py`
**Verifies continuous system physics implementation**

- ✓ Potential field φ(y) = A·sin(2πy/y_max)
- ✓ Velocity update: v' = v + f/m + wobble
- ✓ Position update: y' = y + v
- ✓ Crash mechanics (v → 0, y unchanged)
- ✓ Velocity bounds [-v_max, v_max]
- ✓ Position bounds [-y_max, y_max]

**Run:** `python test_physics.py`

### `test_discretization.py`
**Tests grid structure and discretization functions**

- ✓ Grid construction (uniform spacing, correct bounds)
- ✓ `discretize()` produces valid indices
- ✓ `continuous_state()` returns correct grid values
- ✓ Round-trip consistency (grid → continuous → grid)
- ✓ Nearest neighbor property

**Run:** `python test_discretization.py`

### `test_bellman.py`
**Verifies value iteration mathematical correctness**

- ✓ Bellman optimality: V*(s) = max_a Q*(s,a)
- ✓ Policy is greedy w.r.t. value function
- ✓ Value function convergence
- ✓ Value function bounds [0, r_max/(1-γ)]
- ✓ Goal state has high value

**Run:** `python test_bellman.py` (takes ~1-2 min)

### `run_all_tests.py`
**Master test runner - executes all test suites**

Runs all tests in sequence and generates a comprehensive verification report.

**Run:** `python run_all_tests.py` (takes ~3-5 min)

## 🚀 Quick Start

cd tests/
python run_all_tests.py
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Fast tests (~10 seconds each)

## 📊 Understanding Test Output

### ✅ PASSED
Test verified the expected property holds. Implementation is correct for this aspect.

### ❌ FAILED
Test found a violation of expected behavior. Review the implementation.

### ⚠️ WARNING
Test passed but with caveats. Often acceptable but worth understanding why.

### Example Output
```
==================================================================
TEST: Probabilities Sum to 1.0
==================================================================
✅ PASSED: All 1680 state-action pairs sum to 1.0

Max error: 0.000002
```

## 🔍 What Each Test Category Verifies

### 1. Transition Probabilities
**Why it matters:** If transitions don't sum to 1.0 or contain negative probabilities, the MDP is mathematically invalid.

**What we check:**
- Basic probability axioms
- Correct handling of crash probability
- Gaussian noise integration
- Boundary clipping

### 2. Monte Carlo Validation
**Why it matters:** Analytical formulas can have subtle errors (wrong coefficient, missing term, etc.). Comparing against actual sampling catches these.

**What we check:**
- Total variation distance < 5%
- Agreement on high-probability transitions
- Correct behavior for edge cases

### 3. Physics Implementation
**Why it matters:** If the continuous dynamics don't match the specification, the entire solution is for the wrong problem.

**What we check:**
- Force calculations
- Update equations
- Stochasticity (wobble, crash)
- Boundary enforcement

### 4. Discretization
**Why it matters:** Poor discretization can make states unreachable or create artifacts.

**What we check:**
- Grid covers state space
- Mapping functions are consistent
- No "lost" states

### 5. Bellman Equations
**Why it matters:** Value iteration only works if it satisfies the Bellman optimality equation.

**What we check:**
- V* = max_a Q*(s,a)
- Policy is optimal
- Convergence achieved
- Reasonable value function

## 🐛 Common Issues and Debugging

### Issue: Probabilities don't sum to 1.0
**Likely cause:** Missing probability mass (e.g., forgot crash case) or normalization error

**Fix:** Check `_compute_single_transition()` and ensure all cases are handled

### Issue: Monte Carlo validation fails
**Likely cause:** Analytical formula differs from actual `step()` implementation

**Fix:** Ensure `_compute_single_transition()` exactly mirrors the logic in `step()`

### Issue: Bellman test fails
**Likely cause:** Value iteration didn't converge or Q-value computation is wrong

**Fix:** Increase max_iterations or check `_compute_q_value()`

## 📈 Expected Results

With correct implementation, you should see:

```
🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED - IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED!

✓ Transition probabilities are mathematically correct
✓ Analytical computation matches Monte Carlo sampling
✓ Physics dynamics are implemented correctly
✓ Grid discretization is sound
✓ Value iteration satisfies Bellman optimality

👍 You can trust this AI-generated code!
```

## 🔬 Adding New Tests

When adding features or modifying the implementation:

1. **Add unit tests** for new functions in appropriate test file
2. **Add integration tests** if new components interact
3. **Add edge cases** that might break your implementation
4. **Run full suite** to ensure no regressions

### Test Template
```python
def test_new_feature(self):
    """Test description"""
    print("\n" + "="*60)
    print("TEST: Feature Name")
    print("="*60)
    
    # Setup
    system = self.setup_system()
    
    # Test
    result = system.new_feature()
    expected = ...
    
    # Verify
    if result == expected:
        print("✅ PASSED: Test description")
        return True
    else:
        print(f"❌ FAILED: Expected {expected}, got {result}")
        return False
```

## 🤝 Working with AI

These tests embody a key principle for AI-assisted coding:

> **"Trust, but verify."**

The AI can generate sophisticated implementations quickly, but:
- AI can make subtle mathematical errors
- AI might misunderstand specifications
- Edge cases might be overlooked

By running these tests, you:
1. Verify the implementation is correct
2. Build confidence in the code
3. Catch errors early
4. Document expected behavior
